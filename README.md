# MADF_TSP
MADF mini-project to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem and implement Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Running the Program
To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have XAMPP installed. If not, install XAMPP.
2. Copy all the files into a new folder inside the `htdocs` directory in the XAMPP installation.
3. Start the XAMPP server (Apache and MySQL).
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `localhost/phpmyadmin`.
5. Create a database named `cities` and import the `citydist.sql` file provided into that database.
6. Create another database named `Goa` (case-sensitive) and import the `cities.sql` file into that database.
7. Open a new browser window and navigate to `localhost/Your_folder/index.html`. Make sure to replace `Your_folder` with the name of the folder where you pasted the files.
8. You should now be able to use the program.

## Project Structure
The project may include multiple files and directories. Here's a general overview of the project structure:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the user interface and form.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing client-side logic and AJAX requests.
- `process.php`: PHP file to process the form data and perform the TSP algorithm.
- `dijkstra.php`: PHP file to perform Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Other supporting files and directories.
